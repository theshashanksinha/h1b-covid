- `CASE_STATUS`: Status of the application (Certified, Denied, etc.)
- `EMPLOYER_NAME`: Name of the sponsoring employer
- `WAGE`: Salary offered to the visa applicant
- `JOB_TITLE`: Title of the job position offered to the applicant

For a full description of all data fields, refer to the main report.

## Analysis and Key Findings
### Key Insights
- **Trends in Applications**: Applications surged in 2021, likely due to pent-up demand from the COVID-19 impact.
- **Wage Trends**: Wages offered to H-1B holders increased consistently, even during the pandemic, reflecting sustained demand for foreign talent in tech fields.
